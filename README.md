# Inventory Management System

This repository holds the code for the frontend part of my inventory management system. It's a simple React Native app with React Navigation and Context for state management.

## Requirements

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en)
- Android Studio for Android or Xcode for iOS

## How To

1) Clone the repository: `git clone git@github.com:jenyaftw/ims-app.git`
2) Copy the following config file into `.env.local` in the root directory:
```
EXPO_PUBLIC_API_URL=http://192.168.0.108:8000 # Change this to the IP of the machine you have backend running on
EXPO_PUBLIC_TOKEN_KEY=ims-token
```
3) Install dependencies: `npm install`
4) Now start Expo: `npm run start`

Woohoo! Congrats, you got it up and running! Now just download Expo on your phone and you'll be able to run the app.
